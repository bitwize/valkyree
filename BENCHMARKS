In order to assess Valkyree's performance I devised a simple benchmark:
render an 8-second clip of "Chopsticks" in 2-part harmony using an instrument
based on Valkyree's square-wave generator function with a sampling frequency of
22050 Hz. The stuff necessary to run the tests is in the test/ directory.

Here are the results:

Test machine: 3.3GHz Intel Pentium 4 Toshiba laptop, 512MB RAM

Gauche 0.8.6
Method of testing:
  time gosh gauche-driver.scm

Gambit 4.0b17
Method of testing:
  /usr/local/Gambit-C/bin/gsc -dynamic gambit-driver.scm
  time /usr/local/Gambit-C/bin/gsi gambit-driver.o1

Chicken 2.2
Method of testing:
  csc chicken-driver.scm -o chicken-driver
  time ./chicken-driver


         Time to execute   Time relative to
             (sec.)        sound length
                           (1.00 = real time)

Gauche       9.804            1.23

Chicken      6.237            0.78

Gambit     129.007           16.13
