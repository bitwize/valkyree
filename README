This is Valkyree -- a sound and music generation system for Gambit.

Not much here right now, so feel free to hack and send patches.

Note: syntax-case must be enabled. Put (include "~~/syntax-case.scm") in your
gambcext or gambcini before attempting to use Valkyree.

The order of compilation/evaluation is:

  valk-snd.scm
  valk-seq.scm
  valk-file.scm
  <your application file(s)>

Try the test! (it's in valk-test.scm)
